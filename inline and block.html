    <!-- block element -->
    <p style="border: 2px solid black">Web Technology</p>
<div style="border: 2px solid black">Internet and Intranet</div>

<p>The P and the DIV elements are both block elements, and they will always start on a new line and take up the full width available
 (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can).</p>
<!-- inline element -->
 <p>No one actually owns the <span style="border: 2px solid black">Internet</span> and no single person or organization controls 
    the internet.</p>

<a style="border: 1px solid rgb(1, 1, 43);">The SPAN element is an inline element, and will not start on a new line and 
    only takes up as much width as necessary.</a>
